  <h2>About cats</h2>
  <p>Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness. Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision
    and night vision are much better than that of humans. Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw;
    four toes on each back paw). Cats can jump up to six times their length.</p>

  <h2>Why cats are better than dogs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1. Cat people are more intelligent than dog people.</li>
    <li>2. Cats have a smaller carbon footprint than dogs.</li>
    <li>3. Cats are less slobbery than dogs.</li>
    <li>4. Owning a cat may reduce your risk of dying from a heart attack.</li>
  </ul>
